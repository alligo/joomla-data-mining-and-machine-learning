# joomla-data-mining-sql-queries/output
This directory contains sample output of some of the queries for selected projects.

Note that for real projects, you would probably have at least a few thousand
entries. If you are not 100% sure, run the queries on a test server with backup
of the data in production, because the queries in sql/ are complex.
